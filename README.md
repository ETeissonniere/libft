# Libft

Wanted to train for the 42 coding school, so figured out I would just do their projects.

## Usage

- `make` to build
- `make re` to rebuild
- `make clean` or `make fclean` to clean


## What for?

Mostly for the challenge, this might be useless in most cases.
Also added some C utility functions that are not in the `libc`, those might come useful.


## Tests

Tested and hardened against [libft-unit-test](https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test).
